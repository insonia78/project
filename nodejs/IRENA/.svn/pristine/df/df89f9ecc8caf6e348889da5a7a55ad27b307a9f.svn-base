The "solar" folder includes the hourly rating factor for solar energy.

The "wind" folder includes the hourly rating factor for wind energy.

The "yr1" folder includes the solution for year 1. The "yr2" folder includes the solution for year 2.
-"base" subfolder includes the solution for base case without new energy storage. 
-"es" subfolder includes the solution for energy storage case which new energy storage is included.
-The csv file provides hourly base demand profile without considering the peak demand and annual energy demand.
